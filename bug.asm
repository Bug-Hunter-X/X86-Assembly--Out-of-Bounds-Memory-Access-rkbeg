mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, the product of ECX and 4, and 0x10.  The problem lies in the potential for this calculation to result in an address outside the bounds of allocated memory. If ECX is a large number, it could lead to a segmentation fault.
